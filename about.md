Hey there, my name is Sheng Yeong. I am based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

I have tons of ideas, opinions, and questions on food hacks, work productivity, math, science, art and philosophy. I like to talk to true, intelligent and wise people, because there is always a paradigm shift in me on those encounters.

The reason I started this blog is because as I age, I realized I tend to forget important lessons learnt in life. However, for matters that I meticulously and deliberately write down and draw, I will be able to recall easily. So, this blog serves to help me keep a record of my past thoughts. In another way, helping me keep a presence of mind for truths. Helping me be mindful.

Additionally, there is no point keeping my experience and knowledge to myself. In an age where information is shared freely, I hope this blog is beneficial to you as it is to me.
